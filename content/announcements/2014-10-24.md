Hello, everyone! As usual, this week's meeting is going to be this Friday from 4â€“6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor of GCCIS. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through!

We don't have anything planned for today, so, we're going to have another open meeting this week. Both hours will be open for discussion.

We hope to see you at this week's meeting!
