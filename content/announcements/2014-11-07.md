Hello, everyone! As usual, this week's meeting is going to be this Friday from 4â€“6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor of GCCIS. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through!

As the semester winds down, we're going to spend this week talking about plans for events for the spring semester. As usual, the second hour of the meeting will be reserved for open discussion.

We hope to see you at this week's meeting!
