Hello, everyone! As usual, this week's meeting is going to be this Friday from 4â€“6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor of GCCIS. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through!

This week, we're going to spend the first hour working together on an "introduction to Linux" presentation that we'll show at the beginning of the spring semester. We're going to be figuring out what we know about Linux and just how much we need to say to a new Linux user so that they know what to expect. The second half of the meeting will be reserved for open discussion.

We hope to see you at this week's meeting!
