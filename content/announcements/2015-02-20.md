Hi, everyone! As usual, this week's meeting is Friday from 4â€“6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through!

This week's meeting will be a presentation/workshop on Gentoo by Gabriel Marcano. He'll be giving us a tour of what it's like to install and work with Gentoo, and how it's not as scary (or as scary) as people think.

The presentation will be about an hour long, and the remaining hour of the meeting will be left open to socialise. If you're looking to install Linux on your laptop, or install Gentoo, we're here to help!

We hope to see you at this week's meeting!
