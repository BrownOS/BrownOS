Hi, everyone! Our first meeting of the semester is this Friday from 4â€“6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through!

First off, we're trying something new this spring: all of the semester's events will be kept on a public schedule, which you can find [here](/schedule.htm). If you're interested in doing a presentation this semester, check out what weeks are free and talk to one of the members of Eboard!

For the first week, we're having an open meeting where people can show up, meet people, hang out, and ask questions about installing Linux. If you aren't sure where to start, bring your laptop and we'll help you install Linux before the meeting ends. Be sure to tell your friends; everyone's invited!

We hope to see you at this week's meeting!
