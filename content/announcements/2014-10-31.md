Hello, everyone! As usual, this week's meeting is going to be this Friday from 4â€“6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor of GCCIS. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through!

For Halloween, we're going to talk about spooky things that you have or can set up on your Linux machine, like SystemD. The second hour of the meeting will be reserved for open discussion.

We hope to see you at this week's meeting!
