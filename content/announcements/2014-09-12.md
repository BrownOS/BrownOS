Hello, everyone! As usual, this week's meeting is going to be this Friday from 4â€“6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor of GCCIS. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through!

This week, we're going to spend approximately the first hour talking about various scripting languages, including Python, Shell, Node.js, possibly Perl. Even if you don't know how to program, you can still come! The second hour of the meeting will be reserved for open discussion.

We hope to see you at this week's meeting!
