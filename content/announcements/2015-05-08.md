Hi, everyone! As usual, this week's meeting is Friday from 4â€“6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through! This is our last (official) meeting for the academic year, and we're not going to be meeting over the summer.

This meeting, we're going to discuss a few logistical things like elections, plans for next year, and a potential get-together before the year actually ends. Other than that, we have nothing planned; just time to sit around and talk.

We hope to see you at this week's meeting! If you can't make it this time, have a good summer! If you're still a student next year, or an incoming freshman, look out for us at the club fair during New Student Orientation!
