Hello, everyone! As usual, this week's meeting is going to be this Friday from 4â€“6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor of GCCIS. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through!

Like the previous weeks, we don't have a major topic set for this meeting. Next week, we're not having a meeting because of thanksgiving, and the next week, plan to show up to the room on time because we're going to meet up and drive somewhere to have food and congratulate our graduating members.

We hope to see you at this week's meeting!
