Hello, everyone! As usual, this week's meeting is going to be this Friday from 4â€“6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor of GCCIS. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through!

This week, we're going to spend approximately the first hour talking about [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy). We're going to be talking about what you can do to create a PGP key, what you should do to protect it, signing emails, encrypting files, and other things that you can do with PGP. We'll also mention [OTR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging) and some other security-conscious software. The second hour of the meeting will be reserved for open discussion.

We hope to see you at this week's meeting!
