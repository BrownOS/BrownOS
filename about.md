*BrownOS hosts weekly meetings. Meetings are {{ site.brownos-day }}s {{ site.brownos-time }} in {{ site.brownos-place }}.*

The BrownOS is an open-source community club for new and experienced users of [Github](github.com). Although our main topic of focus is open-source community, we often discuss other topics in [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

Our meeting format is typically a presentation or workshop followed by open discussion. Meeting topics and summaries will be posted on the website weekly.

We're always open to suggestions for future meetings. If you'd like to contact us for any reason, send an email to <a href="#" id="our-email" data-mail="brownos">(needs JavaScript)</a><script>(function(){var e=document.getElementById('our-email');e.innerHTML=e.dataset.mail+'@brown.edu';e.href='mailto:'+e.innerHTML})()</script> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BrownOpenSource/">find us on Facebook</a>.

BrownOS also has a largely open-source governance process. Most of BrownOS's governing documents are available on Github and accept contributions. If you're a BrownOS member who thinks there's something we can do better, let us know or submit a pull request.
