Hey RITluggers! Happy week 13!

This week we'll be talking about how you can create your own Linux distribution.

This is the final step in taking 'system customization' to the extreme. We will start with a base system (Ubuntu in this case) and build up our own changes and software packages, boot splash screens, login greeter, and desktop environment and package it into a standard disk image to use as install media to share your linux remix system.

While learning all of this for myself I have started creating my own distribution called repkamOS, based on Ubuntu 15.04. This is what all of the examples and scripts that are shown will be based on.We will learn a bit about the various tools and theories that go into this type of more complex Linux project.

As usual, the remainder of the meeting after the presentation we'll open the floor to any further discussion on today's topic or other FOSS topics, technical help, and give you time to get your hands dirty.

If you have a cool project, know about something in the FOSS world that's super cool, or find a project or topic you'd like to hear more about, let us know! We'd be happy to schedule a week for you or someone you know to give a talk or try to work it into our schedule.
