Hey RITluggers!

This week we'll talk about different package managers. Package managers handle installing software (and the things the software needs) on your system. We'll look at some of the Linux package managers such as apt, pacman, dnf, and portage as well as package managers you may encounter while writing or installing custom software including pip (Python) and npm (Node).

As usual, for the remainder of the meeting after the presentation we’ll open the floor to any further discussion on today’s topic or other FOSS topics, Q and A, technical help, and give you time to get your hands dirty.

If you have a cool project, know about something in the FOSS world that’s super cool, or find a project or topic you’d like to hear more about, let us know! We’d love to learn about it.
