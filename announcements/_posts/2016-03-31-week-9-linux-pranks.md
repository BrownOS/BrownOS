Hey RITluggers!

This week our meeting is on April 1st, April Fools Day! To celebrate this, we are going to be sharing some silly and fun Linux Pranks with you!
We will present some of our favorite linux and computer pranks but if you know of any good ones be sure to share them with us during the meeting. 

As usual, for the remainder of the meeting after the presentation we’ll open the floor to any further discussion on today’s topic or other FOSS topics, Q and A, technical help, and give you time to get your hands dirty.
If you have a cool project, know about something in the FOSS world that’s super cool, or find a project or topic you’d like to hear more about, let us know! We’d love to learn about it.
