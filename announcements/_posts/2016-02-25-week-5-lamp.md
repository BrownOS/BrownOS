Hey RITluggers! Happy Week 5!

In this week's meeting we'll talk about getting started with a LAMP server, a fairly standard webserver setup using Linux, Apache, Mysql, and PHP. We'll also mention some alternatives to LAMP technologies such as Nginx and PostgreSQL as well as how the container technology we mentioned a few weeks ago can be helpful with a LAMP server.

As usual, for the remainder of the meeting after the presentation we’ll open the floor to any further discussion on today’s topic or other FOSS topics, Q and A, technical help, and give you time to get your hands dirty.

If you have a cool project, know about something in the FOSS world that’s super cool, or find a project or topic you’d like to hear more about, let us know! We’d love to learn about it.
