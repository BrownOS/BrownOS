Hey RITluggers! Happy almost-Thanksgiving!

RITlug will *not* have a meeting this week and the lab will not be open.
Enjoy your Thanksgiving! Meetings will resume next week on December 4th.

Need some RITlug in the interim? [Join our Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ritlug) or jump in our IRC
channel (#ritlug on Freenode).

If you run a cool project or know about something in the FOSS world that's
super cool, let us know! We'd be happy to schedule a week for you to give a talk.
