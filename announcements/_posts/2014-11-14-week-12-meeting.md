Hello, everyone! As usual, this week's meeting is going to be this Friday from 4â€“6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor of GCCIS. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through!

Continuing off of the stuff from last week, we're going to spend this week's meeting talking about the topics of the weeks for next semester, what's in store for the club, and a potential end-of-semester celebration for our members that are done with classes after this fall. As usual, the second hour of the meeting will be reserved for open discussion.

We hope to see you at this week's meeting!
