Hey RITluggers!

This Friday we'll talk about filesystems. Filesystems deal with how your data is stored on your hard drive and often
offer some extra features that make your life easier. If you're new to Linux or don't know what a filesystem is,
this will give you some insight into what you're choosing when you install a new system and are asked for what to use. We'll look at EXT, BTRFS, and ZFS which are three of the major Linux filesystems (though not the only ones!). If there's time and interest, we'll take a closer look at ZFS, which is a really powerful filesystem with a lot of interesting features - and it's easy to use!

As usual, for the second portion of the meeting we'll break for any impromptu presentations, questions, or tech
support, and give you time to get your hands dirty.
