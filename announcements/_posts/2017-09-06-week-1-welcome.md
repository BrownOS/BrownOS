Hi everyone!

Welcome back to school. Hope everyone had a great summer!

We are excited to bring open-source awareness to Brown by introducing basic Git concepts, applying skills in small projects, then expanding it further to bigger open-source projects available at Brown or on Github.

We started the club because we noticed that while most CS courses teach valuable concepts and skills in various areas, there isn't formal introduction to Github. Our aim is to help you familiarize yourself with the open-source community and actually contribute to projects out there by making pull requests or pushing to repos.

We hope you have a **blast** with us!


#### tl;dr 

* Time/date: TBD, 2017, ?pm - ?pm (**CIT???**)
* Talk:  Open Source 101 with Mozilla


#### Don't forget! 

The best way to keep in touch with the club is our email brownos@brown.edu. We also have a github page, as listed below.

Looking forward to working with you all,
