Hi everyone!

Welcome back to school. Hope everyone had a great summer!

We are excited to bring open-source awareness to Brown by introducing basic Git concepts, applying skills in small projects, then expanding it further to bigger open-source projects available at Brown or on Github.

Charlene and I started the club, because we noticed that while most CS courses teach valuable concepts and skills in different topics, using Github is often something not covered in courses. Our aim is to help you familiarize yourself with the open-source community and make pull requests to actually contribute to projects out there.

We hope you have a **blast** throughout the semester!
