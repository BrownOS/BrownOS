Hi everyone!

Welcome back to school. Hope everyone had a great summer!

We are excited to bring open-source awareness to Brown by introducing basic Git concepts, applying skills in small projects, then expanding it further to bigger open-source projects available at Brown or on Github.

We started the club because we noticed that while most CS courses teach valuable concepts and skills in computer science, there really isn't a formal introduction to Git or Github. Our aim is to help you familiarize yourself with the open-source community and contribute to projects.

The first kick-off event is happening this weekend on Sept. 24th, 2017 in CIT368 from 1:30pm to 4:00pm. We invited two representatives from Mozilla who together will be introducing our club, give you a brief introduction of what open source is and why you should work open source, and wrap up by helping you work through an open source project WebVR Beautiful World.

If you're thinking of coming, please <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2Fforms%2F270Fs6mAOiIPZLhG2&h=ATMN03jg5aCHOso7V3I8FSNIO-Ft-NPMqHpHiLqyOKJqWzz9pvbIECLR439txCS_LYFThy4OrFoBCJ1r1BfyijMUa1jt9dYFJqTXOrFi6uxASbqqm-Vd3jOs6wMn_ZkcsIlnhbZbrgXbXbQ0YNruAOTm-K6X1IOZaTzBlsHIU2LqAse0MnooZX0">RSVP here</a> and don't forget to bring your own laptop with Git installed.
