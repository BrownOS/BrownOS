Hello, everyone! As usual, this week's meeting is going to be this Friday from 4â€“6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor of GCCIS. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through!

A lot of us went to the career fair this week, so, we're going to spend this week's meeting relaxing and talking about our experience with using Linux in industry. We'll take the time to share what kinds of things are good to know for your next co-op, or what some people have done in the past. There will be no presentation this week.

We hope to see you at this week's meeting!
