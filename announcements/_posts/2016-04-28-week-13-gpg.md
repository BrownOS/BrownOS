Happy Week 13, RITluggers!

This week we'll discuss GPG. We'll look at what it is and why it's useful, and walk you through creating your own GPG key and the keysigning process. Slides will be posted after the meeting, but if you're interested in following along during the meeting and intend to keep the key you create, please bring your own computer. We'll also officially announce the election results for next year's eboard.

If you haven't yet voted for the 2016-2017 eboard and want to, make sure to get your votes in before tomorrow morning. Vote at https://goo.gl/CxRXEX.

As usual, for the remainder of the meeting after the presentation we’ll open the floor to any further discussion on today’s topic or other FOSS topics, Q and A, technical help, and give you time to get your hands dirty. If you have a cool project, know about something in the FOSS world that’s super cool, or find a project or topic you’d like to hear more about, let us know! We’d love to learn about it.
