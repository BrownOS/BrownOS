Hey there, RITluggers!

This week we'll talk about shell scripting and some of the system automation technologies available on Linux such as services, cronjobs, and timers.

As usual, for the remainder of the meeting after the presentation we’ll open the floor to any further discussion on today’s topic or other FOSS topics, Q and A, technical help, and give you time to get your hands dirty.

If you have a cool project, know about something in the FOSS world that’s super cool, or find a project or topic you’d like to hear more about, let us know! We’d love to learn about it.
