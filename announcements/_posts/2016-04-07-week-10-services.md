Happy Week 10, RITluggers!

This week we'll look at some of the cool services available to you in Linux that make life easier. We'll look at solutions such as GOGS (private git hosting), Emby (media server software), Ajenti and Cockpit (monitoring and control), and more.

As usual, for the remainder of the meeting after the presentation we’ll open the floor to any further discussion on today’s topic or other FOSS topics, Q and A, technical help, and give you time to get your hands dirty. If you have a cool project, know about something in the FOSS world that’s super cool, or find a project or topic you’d like to hear more about, let us know! We’d love to learn about it.
