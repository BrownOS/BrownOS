Hello, everyone! Our first meeting of the year is going to be this Friday from 4â€“6 in GOL/70-2520, the small database lab on the second floor. If you can only attend part of the meeting, don't be afraid to show up halfway through!

This week, we're going to be getting to know each other, and our members who use Linux regularly are going to have a chance to show off some of the cool things that they've done with Linux on their laptops.

This is also a good time for those who haven't installed Linux to take a peek at what using a free OS on a day-to-day basis is like.

Because this is the first meeting, we'll be spending the entire time getting to know each other, showing off our Linux setups, and talking more about what the club is about. Next week's meeting will have a one-hour presentation followed by discussion.

We hope to see you at this week's meeting!
