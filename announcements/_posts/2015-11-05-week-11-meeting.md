Hey RITluggers!

This Friday we'll talk about NodeJS and JavaScript! I have been a JavaScript developer for the last five months now and have focused on building a large web application using Reactjs and Flux. These two technologies were created by Facebook to help developers quickly create logical user interfaces and to control application logic. There is a ton of stuff you can do with JavaScript and NodeJS, not only in a browser, but as a powerful scripting language on your system.


As usual, for the second portion of the meeting we'll break for any impromptu presentations, questions, or tech
support, and give you time to get your hands dirty.
