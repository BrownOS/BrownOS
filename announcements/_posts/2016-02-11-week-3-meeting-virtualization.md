Happy Week 3, RITluggers!

Containerization and virtualization are two different ways of isolating sections of applications or servers in order to make them more portable, easier to manage, and ideally, safer. They're also great for experimenting with operating systems and applications without needing to replace the operating system you already have. We'll get into that and the differences between them during the meeting.

This week we'll look at some of the virtualization and container technologies available on Linux. Specifically, we'll talk about VirtualBox, Xen, KVM/QEMU, and Libvirt on the virtualization side, and Docker and Systemd-nspawn on the container side.

As usual, for the remainder of the meeting after the presentation we'll open the floor to any further discussion on today's topic or other FOSS topics, technical help, and give you time to get your hands dirty.

If you have a cool project, know about something in the FOSS world that's super cool, or find a project or topic you'd like to hear more about, let us know! We'd love to learn about it.
