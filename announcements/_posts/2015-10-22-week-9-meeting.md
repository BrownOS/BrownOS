Hey RITluggers! Happy week 9!

As a tie-in to last week's desktop customization meeting, this Friday we'll talk about customizing your shell.
Customizing your shell can range from changing the appearance (your prompt, colors, etc) to making your shell
work the way you do. If you're relatively new to the shell, this can be a good way of getting more familiar with
it and making it act how you think it should. If you're more experienced, it can be interesting to get some new
inspiration for your workflow.

As usual, we'll break for the second part of the meeting so you can get your hands dirty, discuss any other FOSS
topics, and get any technical help you may need.
