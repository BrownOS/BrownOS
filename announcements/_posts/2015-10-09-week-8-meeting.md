Hey RITluggers! Happy week 8!

This week we'll look at desktop customization, including tools and some themes to get you started on your own.

As usual, the second portion of the meeting we'll break off and open the floor to any other thoughts and give you
some time to get your hands dirty.

If you haven't already, take our survey! We want to make RITlug better, but we can't do that without your help.
Also feel free to talk to us at any time if you have any concerns. [http://goo.gl/forms/DnKHYeOruW](http://goo.gl/forms/DnKHYeOruW)
(requires an RIT login).
