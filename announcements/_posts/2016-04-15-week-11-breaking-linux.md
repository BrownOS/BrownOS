Happy Friday, RITluggers!

This week we'll break Linux in a variety of brutal ways (rm -rf / --no-preserve-root, anyone?), see what happens, and see if and how we can bring it back.

As a reminder, elections will be held next week. If you're interested in running for next year's eboard, fill out https://goo.gl/Cle0bG. You must have regularly attended meetings this semester to be eligible to run. We currently have nominations for president and vice president but none for secretary or treasurer (though you can of course run for any position).

As usual, for the remainder of the meeting after the presentation we’ll open the floor to any further discussion on today’s topic or other FOSS topics, Q and A, technical help, and give you time to get your hands dirty. If you have a cool project, know about something in the FOSS world that’s super cool, or find a project or topic you’d like to hear more about, let us know! We’d love to learn about it.
