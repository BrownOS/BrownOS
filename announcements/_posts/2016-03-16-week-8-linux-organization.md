Happy Almost-Friday, RITluggers!

This week we'll look at what all the things in "/" are. Although things may seem a little arbitrary when you're first finding your way around, Linux does have an organizational scheme. This is helpful to know for finding things of course, but also for learning where things should be placed if you write your own software. There's also some cool things to explore, such as /dev (most system hardware) and /proc (running system information, including all your processes).

As usual, for the remainder of the meeting after the presentation we’ll open the floor to any further discussion on today’s topic or other FOSS topics, Q and A, technical help, and give you time to get your hands dirty.

If you have a cool project, know about something in the FOSS world that’s super cool, or find a project or topic you’d like to hear more about, let us know! We’d love to learn about it.
