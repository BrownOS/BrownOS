Hey RITluggers! Happy week 12!

This week we'll take a look at building a media server based on Linux. We'll take a look at some configuration options for building a Linux-based media server as well as a selection of software packages that provide access to media via mobile apps, your browser, and Chromecast (among other things). We'll also take a look at a couple of existing media server setups based on some of those options.

As usual, the remainder of the meeting after the presentation we'll open the floor to any further discussion on today's topic or other FOSS topics, technical help, and give you time to get your hands dirty.

If you have a cool project, know about something in the FOSS world that's super cool, or find a project or topic you'd like to hear more about, let us know! We'd be happy to schedule a week for you or someone you know to give a talk or try to work it into our schedule.
