This week we'll spend the first part of the meeting looking at how to contribute to open source projects on Github
in honour of Hacktoberfest. We'll go through the process of forking, making changes, and creating a pull request.
If there's time and interest since that may be a quick presentation, we'll take a look at the process of installing
Linux manually by walking through how to do an ArchLinux install.

As usual, the second portion of the meeting we'll break and open the floor to any other presentations or questions
and in general give you time to get your hands dirty with some help if you're working on something in Linux.

_(If you get this email twice, that means you're part of both our RIT roster on TheLink and our public mailing list.
Feel free to adjust your notification settings for one or both.)_
