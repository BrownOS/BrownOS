We redesigned our website to use Material Design and a simplified Jekyll setup, in hopes of making the website more accessible to anyone interested in contributing. This is part of our efforts to streamline RITlug's administrative processes to make it easier to contribute and easier to pass off Eboard responsibilities between years.

Upgrading our website has been an ongoing project, hence the lack of regular website updates. Now that things are up and running again we'll resume our regularly scheduled website updates which should also revive our mailing list. As an aside, if you're currently on our public mailing list on Google Groups and you have an RIT computer account, we suggest joining our roster on TheLink @ RIT instead. TheLink is the official source of information and mailings for RIT-affiliated individuals and allows us to keep better statistics about our membership.
